# Logistic Regression on Iris Dataset  

## Overview  
This project applies **Logistic Regression** — one of the most popular classification algorithms — on the classic **Iris Dataset**.  
The goal is to predict the species of iris flowers (*Setosa, Versicolor,* or *Virginica*) based on four input features:  
- Sepal Length  
- Sepal Width  
- Petal Length  
- Petal Width

## Project Workflow  
1. **Data Loading & Exploration:**  
   - Loaded the Iris dataset from `sklearn.datasets`.  
   - Explored feature distributions and class labels.  

2. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Split data into training and test sets.  
   - Standardized features using `StandardScaler`.  

3. **Model Training:**  
   - Implemented **Logistic Regression** using `scikit-learn`.  
   - Trained the model on the training dataset.  

4. **Evaluation:**  
   - Predicted on the test dataset.  
   - Measured accuracy and analyzed classification results.
